## Complaint Kendra Project Reference Document

### Project Overview

**Complaint Kendra** is a structured complaint management platform designed to handle complaints from users based on departments, categories, and location-based roles. It includes a user-friendly interface for lodging complaints and a role-based backend for handling them at various administrative levels.

### Core Features

1. **Multi-Level Complaint Categories**
2. Complaints are categorized hierarchically (e.g., Issue > Type > Subtype).
3. Categories are stored in a relational schema to support nesting and querying.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
5. Roles include: citizen, officer, admin, and location-specific officials.
6. Each role can only access or manage data relevant to their scope (e.g., a district officer sees district complaints).
7. **Location-Based Assignment**
8. Users and officials are tied to geographic entities: country > state > district > ward.
9. Complaints are filtered and routed accordingly.
10. **Complaint Lifecycle Management**
11. Complaints have a status enum: pending, in_progress, resolved, rejected, etc.
12. Status changes are tracked, optionally with remarks and timestamps.
13. **File Attachments**
14. Complaints can include image uploads or documents as evidence.
15. **Notification System**
16. Notifications are sent on status changes and assignments.
17. FlatList UI shows a list of notifications with badges indicating status.
18. **ComplaintForm Component**
19. Built using Shaden UI and [zod] validation.
20. Supports dynamic category selection, title input, description, and file attachments.
21. **MyComplaints Screen**
22. A list of user-submitted complaints rendered using FlatList.
23. Complaints are styled with badge indicators and status colors.
24. **Admin Dashboard**
25. Admins can view all complaints, reassign, escalate, or resolve.
26. Includes filters for category, location, and date.

**Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** React / React Native (with Tailwind + Shaden UI)
- **Backend:** Next.js with Prisma ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Role-based using middleware/hooks
- **File Upload:** Cloudinary
- **Notification:** UI-based, real-time updates planned (e.g., socket or polling)

**Prisma Schema Highlights**

- User model includes [role] [locationId]
- Complaint model includes:
  - status | user_id | department_id | category_id | title | attachments |
  - description | location
  - Category | model supports nested categories with self-referencing relation
  - Location | model supports hierarchy (country > state > district > ward)
